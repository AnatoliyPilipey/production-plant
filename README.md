"# production-plant" 
    In a factory it is necessary to keep a record of the products made during a Shift.
There is a Foreman (user) at the head of the Shift.
There are several Workmen on the Shift.
Each Workman has WorkCommitments.
With this information we will know:
            how much production there is,
            we can also compare shifts,
            see what we need to produce more,
            analyze the cost of production.
